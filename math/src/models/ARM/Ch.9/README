Models
======

1. One predictor
electric_one_pred.stan: lm(post_test ~ treatment)

3. Multiple predictors without interaction
electric_multi_preds.stan: lm(post_test ~ treatment + pre_test)

3. Multiple predictors with interaction
electric_interactions.stan: lm(post_test ~ treatment + pre_test + treatment:pre_test)
