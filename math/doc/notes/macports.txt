How to install MacPorts g++

1.  From the download page:

https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/

2.  Snow Leopard:

    MacPorts-2.0.3-10.6-SnowLeopard.dmg

3.  Click on .dmg file

4.  Double click on the .pkg file.

5.  Click through menus (you'll need to enter your password)

6.  Pull up a NEW terminal and run from anywhere:

    > sudo port install gcc46

    You'll need to enter your password again

    NOTE:  On my notebook, I got a lot of errors like:

               Error: Target org.macports.activate returned: Image
	       error: /opt/local/include/gmp.h already exists and does
	       not belong to a registered port.  Unable to activate
	       port gmp. Use 'port -f activate gmp' to force the
	       activation.

           and had to do what it suggested for several packages:

           >  sudo port -f activate gmp

7.  Installed as:

    > g++-mp-4.6

8.  Run Stan with

    > make CC=g++-mp-4.6

    (or make a link)
