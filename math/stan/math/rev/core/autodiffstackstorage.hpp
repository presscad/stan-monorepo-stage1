/**
 * Provides a thread_local singleton. Read warnings below!
 * This is useful in a pretty limited set of circumstances, not just because
 * it's thread_local, but also because of "the static init order fiasco"[0].
 * Anywhere this is used, we must be absolutely positive that it doesn't matter
 * when the singleton will get initialized relative to other static variables.
 * In exchange, we get a much more performant singleton pattern than is
 * available with the standard C++11 singleton pattern relying on a function
 * wrapping a static local variable. There has been some discussion on this; see
 * [1] and [2] and the discussions those PRs link to as well.
 *
 * These are thread_local only if the user asks for it with -DSTAN_THREADS. This
 * is primarily because Apple clang compilers before 2016 don't support
 * thread_local. We have proposed removing support for those[3], and
 * at that time we should evaluate the performance of a switch to thread_local.
 * If there is no loss in performance, we can remove this ifdef.
