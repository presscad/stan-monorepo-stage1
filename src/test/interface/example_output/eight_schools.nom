All transitions within treedepth limit.

7 of 1000 (0.7%) transitions ended with a divergence.
These divergent transitions indicate that HMC is not fully able to explore the posterior distribution.
Try increasing adapt delta closer to 1.
If this doesn't remove all divergences, try to reparameterize the model.

The E-BFMI, 0.26, is below the nominal threshold of 0.3 which suggests that HMC may have trouble exploring the target distribution.
If possible, try to reparameterize the model.
