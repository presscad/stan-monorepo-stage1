Data
====

1. kiddiq.data.R
- N         : number of observations
- kid_score : cognitive test scores of three- and four-year-old children
- mom_hs    : did mother complete high school? 1: Yes, 0: No
- mom_iq    : mother IQ score
- mom_hs_new: new data for prediction
- mom_iq_new: new data for prediction

2. kids_before1987.data.R
- N   : number of observations
- ppvt: cognitive test scores of children born before 1987
- hs  : did mother complete high school? 1: Yes, 0: No
- afqt: normalized mother IQ score (mean = 100, sd = 15)

3. kids_after1987.data.R
- ppvt_ev: cognitive test scores of children born in 1987 or later
- hs_ev  : did mother complete high school? 1: Yes, 0: No
- afqt_ev: normalized mother IQ score (mean = 100, sd = 15)

Models
======

1. One predictor
kidscore_momhs.stan: kid_score ~ mom_hs
kidscore_momiq.stan: kid_score ~ mom_iq

2. Multiple predictors with no interaction
kidiq_multi_preds.stan: kid_score ~ mom_hs + mom_iq

3. Multiple predictors with interaction
kidiq_interaction.stan: kid_score ~ mom_hs + mom_iq + mom_hs:mom_iq

4. Prediction
kidiq_prediction.stan: 
- fitted   : kid_score ~ mom_hs + mom_iq
- predicted: kid_score_pred ~ mom_hs_new + mom_iq_new

5. External validation
kidiq_validation.stan: 
- fitted   : ppvt ~ hs + afqt
- validated: R code
