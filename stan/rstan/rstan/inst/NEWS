2. New features 
   * add makeconf.path function to obtain the full path for file Makeconf 
   * add Rhat legend for stanfit's plot 
   * support saving stanfit object for reusing across R sessions

1. Bug fixes
   * plot for stanfit wide y-axis 
   * print for stanfit class 
   * not working binary build for Mac, this is because variables for 
     the path of header files are using values computed when the package is built.  

2. New features
   * add standard error of mean (SE.Mean) to print of stanfit 
   * function stan allow suing previous fitted stanfit object by adding
     parameter 'fit'
   * allow some type of interruption during sampling 
   * allow data for function stan to be specified as object names 

3. Others 
   * more documentation 
   * use GPL for License and add LicenseNote in DESCRIPTION file
