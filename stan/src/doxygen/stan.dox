 * @section what_is What is Stan?
 *
 * Stan is a C++ library for computations involving probability,
 * sampling, and optimization.
 *
 * @subsection components Components
 *
 * Stan consists of the following largely independent components
 *
 * <ul>	
 * <li>(Adaptive) Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Sampling
 * <li>Directed Graphical Model Compiler
 * <li>Reverse Mode Algorithmic Differentiation
 * <li>Probability Distributions
 * <li>Special Functions
 * <li>Matrices and Linear Algebra
 * </ul>	
 *
 * Models may be written directly using C++ or in the 
 * <a href="http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/">BUGS</a>-like language
 * which is compiled to C++.  
 *
 * @subsection rinterface Interface to R
 *
 * Stan may be invoked from <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>
 * following the pattern of 
 * <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R2WinBUGS/index.html">R2WinBugs</a>.
 *
 * @section license Open-Source Licensing
 *
 * Stan is released under the 
 * <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">New BSD license</a> (aka
 * modified BSD or 3-clause BSD).  
 *
 * <p>Portions of Stan have dependencies on <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a>

 * (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">Lesser Gnu Public License 3+</a>).
 * Compatible versions of Boost and Eigen are distributed with Stan.
 * 
 * <p>The R interface has dependencies on <a href="http://statistics.columbia.edu/people-full/106">R</a> 
 * (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">Gnu Public License, version 3</a>).  R must be
 * downloaded and installed separately.  The combination of Stan and R is then governed under the
 * Gnu Public License, version 3, as required by the Gnu Public License's compatibility terms.
